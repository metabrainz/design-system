## About

This directory contains MetaBrainz branding elements, such as [fonts](./fonts), [logos](./logos) and [templates](./templates).

For brand guidelines (how to use these elements) please see <a href="../guidelines/design-guidelines.md">design-guidelines.md</a>.

## Attribution

When required, a MetaBrainz project attribution must appear in the following places:

1. Each *page* that displays data from a MetaBrainz project must include a short piece of attribution text AND one of the following:
   * A text link that links to the MetaBrainz project (e.g. https://musicbrainz.org )
   * A small logo of the MetaBrainz project
2. An *about us* type page must display a prominent MetaBrainz project logo and attribution text.

Attribution is required in each format (*page*) or platform where the licensor uses our data (e.g. a
website, app or presentation). The attribution, or *pages* where it appears, must not be selectively
hidden from users, or from search engines. When using MetaBrainz logos you must abide by the guidelines
linked on this page. If in doubt, please [reach out to MetaBrainz](https://metabrainz.org/contact) and ask.


### Attribution examples

#### Per page attribution example

Text and link, displayed in the footer of every page that uses MusicBrainz data:</br>

##### Option A

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Powered with data from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/)*

##### Option B

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *Powered with data from MusicBrainz* <img src="../brand/logos/MusicBrainz/SVG/MusicBrainz_logo_icon.svg" alt="MusicBcrainz logo" height="25px" align="bottom">

NOTE: It isn't possible for us to align logo correctly here on this GitHub page -- hopefully it will look better on your own page.
