# MusicBrainz Design System

The humble beginnings of a grand MusicBrainz redesign. ðŸŽ¨

## About

This design system is a living, breathing document that contains all of the building blocks (React components, colors, icons, layout, etc) of the MusicBrainz website. It aims to be single source of truth for developers and designers. Still a work in progress, always will be. 

## Usage

We are working on the beta version, instructions for usage to be added soon. We also have plans to make it available as a npm package.
